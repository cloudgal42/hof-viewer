# Hall of Fame Viewer
A React webapp that utilizes the [Hall Of Fame (HoF)](https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/mods/90641/Windows) API to allow users to browse and view city screenshots by creator name or ID. Users can also group screenshots by city name and see the city stats as well as the total amount of favorites and views in HoF.
